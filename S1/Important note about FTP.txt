Important note about FTP
The next video comes in two versions:

Cyberduck (Compatible with Mac, Windows)

FileZilla (Compatible with Mac, Windows, Linux)

You can find a detailed comparison here: https://www.slant.co/versus/1711/5954/~cyberduck_vs_filezilla

These are tools which will help you upload your files to a server and share your websites with the world.

You can choose the one you prefer.

I suggest watching both videos, then deciding which tool you are the most comfortable with. (PS: I prefer Cyberduck for its simplicity)



Feel free to use other tools if you like. Here is an alternative:

Duck - https://duck.sh/ 
(Compatible with Mac, Windows, Linux)
